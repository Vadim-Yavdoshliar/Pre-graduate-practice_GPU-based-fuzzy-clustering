# GPU-based-fuzzy-clustering
---
# Brief overview
Current repository is assumed to contain a GPU-based implementation of clustering algorithms, in particular, Fuzzy-C-Means and its spatial modification for image segmentation. DirectX acts as the main technology in image processing and the segmentation itself. Most likely the final result of the development will be arranged as a framework with simple one-image-one-window output. The whole project is the part of pre-graduate internship.

# Description
## Core idea
- Develop GPU-based hardware accerelated solution of clustering algorithms;
- Develop sustainable and scalable framework-like infrastracture for further diploma project research;

## Technologies used
- C++, for general programming
- HLSL, for GPU-side clustering algorithms computations
- DirectX (Direct3d), to process graphics and connect GPU capabilities to application
- Windows API, for windows creation

## Usefulness
- In perfomance-critical fuzzy image segmentation applications
- (The following lacks evidence of sufficient speed : ) For low-resolution real-time image segmentation
